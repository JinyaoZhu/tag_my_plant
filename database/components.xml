        <FUNCTION>The transparent fluid admitted in the direction of the arrow is guided into a circular
        motion via the swirl plate in the measuring chamber and directed onto the lightweight
        triple vane rotor. The speed of the rotor is proportional to the flow rate and is detected
        without feedback via the built-in optoelectronic infrared system (diode and phototransi-
        stor).&lt;br&gt;
        The integrated amplifier supplies a steady square wave signal, whereby the signal level
        is dependent on the applied supply voltage (5 to 12 V DC).
        Due to the particular design of the rotor, any gas bubbles (air bubbles) which may occur
        in the fluid, are not dissolved, but carried along with the fluid.
        Any assembly position is possible. The direction of flow is indicated by an arrow on the
        sensor housing. Stabilizing zones up or downstream of the measuring device are not
        necessary. &lt;br&gt;
        Flow rate fluctuations or pulsations do not have a negative influence on the resulting
        measurement.&lt;br&gt;
        A protective filter is fitted on the inlet side.&lt;br&gt;
        All parts of the measurement housing in contact with media are made of polyvinylidene
        fluoride (PVDF).

        <DESIGN>
          The capacitive proximity sensor can be attached via an angle bracket and two lock
          nuts. The sensor is of cylindrical design with an M18x1 thread.
        </DESIGN>
        <FUNCTION>
        The operational principle of a capacitive proximity sensor is based on the evaluation of
        the change in capacitance of a capacitor in an RC resonant circuit. The capacitance
        increases, when an object approaches the proximity sensor. This leads to a change in
        the oscillating action of the RC circuit which can be evaluated. The change in capaci-
        tance largely depends on the distance, the dimensions and the dielectric constant of the
        respective material. &lt;br&gt;
        The proximity sensor has a PNP output, i.e. the signal line is switched to positive poten-
        tial in the switched status. The switch is designed in the form of a normally open con-
        tact. The load is connected between the sensor signal output and earth. A yellow light
        emitting diode (LED) indicates the switching status. The capacitive proximity sensor
        cannot be flush fitted. &lt;br&gt;

        <DESIGN>The 2/2-way solenoid valve is installed in the piping by means of quick push-pull connectors.</DESIGN>
        <FUNCTION>The 2/2-way solenoid valve is a directly actuated valve. When the coil is de-energised, the valve is closed by means of spring force.</FUNCTION>
        <NOTE>For a firm attachment, a pipe clamp may be fitted in front and behind the valve.</NOTE>
